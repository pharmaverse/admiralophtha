## Installation

To install the latest development version of the package directly from
GitHub use the following code:

```
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("pharmaverse/admiraloptha", ref = "devel")
```

## Scope

* Build a toolbox of re-usable functions and utilities to create
  Ophthalmology-specific ADaM datasets in R in a modular manner.
* All functions are created based upon the ADaM Implementation Guide
  and aim to facilitate the programming of ADaM dataset standards.

## Expectations

`{admiralophtha}` is expected to complement `{admiral}` and provide
functions to help with the creation of the endpoints required for
ophthalmology ADaMs.

## References and Documentation

* Please refer to the [`{admiral}` References and
  Documentation](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/index.html#references-and-documentation)

## R Versions

Here’s a summary of our strategy for this package related to R versions:

* R versions for developers and users will follow the same as
  `{admiral}` core package.
* For development the `devel` branch of `{admiral}` core is used as a
  dependency. For releasing a new `{admiralophtha}` version it must
  run using the latest released `{admiral}` core version, i.e., `main`
  branch of `{admiral}` core.
