# Introduction

As this is a package extension, if you are new to `{admiral}` then the best place to first start
reading would be this `r dyn_link("Get Started", admiral_homepage, "articles/admiral.html")`
guide. This extension package follows the same main idea and conventions, and re-uses many
functions from `{admiral}`, so it is important to thoroughly understand these to be able to
use `{admiralophtha}`.

This article is in the process of being written. Please use the `{admiralonco}` "Get Started" 
page (commented out at the moment) as a basis.

<!-- # Derivations -->

<!-- The most important functions in `{admiralonco}` are the -->
<!-- [derivations](../reference/index.html#section-derivations). Again these follow the same -->
<!-- conventions as `{admiral}` but are focused to oncology-specific needs. -->

<!-- # Starting a Script -->

<!-- For the oncology ADaM data structures, an overview of the flow and example function calls -->
<!-- for the most common steps are provided by the following vignettes: -->

<!-- - [Creating ADRS](adrs.html) -->
<!-- - [Creating ADTTE](adtte.html) -->

<!-- `{admiralonco}` also provides template R scripts as a starting point. They can be -->
<!-- created by calling `use_ad_template()` from {admiral}, e.g., -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(admiral) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- there used to be some code calling `use_ad_template here (see corresponding admiralonco file) -->
<!-- but it was removed as commenting it out errored the file for some reason. Upond development,  -->
<!-- feel free to locate the code again and paste it in in order to modify it. -->

<!-- A list of all available templates can be obtained by `list_all_templates()` -->
<!-- from {admiral}: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- list_all_templates(package = "admiralonco") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Support -->

<!-- Support is provided via the [admiral Slack -->
<!-- channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269). -->
