# Introduction

As this is a package extension, if you are new to `{admiral}` then the best place to first start
reading would be this [Get Started](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/admiral.html)
guide. This extension package follows the same main idea and conventions, and re-uses many
functions from `{admiral}`, so it is important to thoroughly understand these to be able to
use `{admiralophtha}`.

# Derivations

The most important functions in `{admiralophtha}` are the
[derivations](../reference/index.html). Again these follow the same
conventions as `{admiral}` but are focused to ophthalmology-specific needs.

# Starting a Script

For the ophthalmology ADaM data structures, an overview of the flow and example function calls
for the most common steps are provided by the following vignettes:

- [Creating ADBCVA](adbcva.html)
- [Creating ADOE](adoe.html)
- [Creating ADVFQ](advfq.html)

# Support

Support is provided via the [admiral Slack
channel](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/).

<!-- # Derivations -->

<!-- The most important functions in `{admiralonco}` are the -->
<!-- [derivations](../reference/index.html#section-derivations). Again these follow the same -->
<!-- conventions as `{admiral}` but are focused to oncology-specific needs. -->

<!-- # Starting a Script -->

<!-- For the oncology ADaM data structures, an overview of the flow and example function calls -->
<!-- for the most common steps are provided by the following vignettes: -->

<!-- - [Creating ADRS](adrs.html) -->
<!-- - [Creating ADTTE](adtte.html) -->

<!-- `{admiralonco}` also provides template R scripts as a starting point. They can be -->
<!-- created by calling `use_ad_template()` from {admiral}, e.g., -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(admiral) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- there used to be some code calling `use_ad_template here (see corresponding admiralonco file) -->
<!-- but it was removed as commenting it out errored the file for some reason. Upond development,  -->
<!-- feel free to locate the code again and paste it in in order to modify it. -->

<!-- A list of all available templates can be obtained by `list_all_templates()` -->
<!-- from {admiral}: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- list_all_templates(package = "admiralonco") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Support -->
